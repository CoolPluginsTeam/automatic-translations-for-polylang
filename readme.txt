== Description ==

**Automatic Translations For Polylang**
Reduce your translation <strong>workload by 50%</strong> with this efficient PolyLang addon. Not only does it duplicate your original or default language <strong>post content</strong>, but it also <strong>translates core and specific blocks</strong> into other languages of the same post, significantly streamlining the translation process.

This addon enables you to <strong>replicate page/post titles, content, images, galleries, </strong>and all associated meta fields. By duplicating and translating the content, you can focus solely on translating the necessary elements without the hassle of setting featured images, adding galleries, or reinserting other content.

Moreover, there's no need to repeatedly restyle your page, as this addon seamlessly copies all styles and formats and translate content from the original post. Simplify your multilingual website management with ease.
